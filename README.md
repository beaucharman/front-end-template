**Notes:**
+ Browser requirements are desktop IE8+, latest versions of Webkit.
+ Development browsers are:
+ This site is responsive with a minimum size of 320px and at least should support iPad portrait and landscape.
+ Unfortunately the designer hasn’t done mobile designs and would like you to recommend the solution directly in the HTML so they can review it after you’ve built it.
+  JS functionality (you can use jQuery as well if you like):
+ The designer has requested a carousel. The animation can be chosen by you and it should also work on mobile
+ Large images without captions will have a modal window that displays the caption on click of the image.
+ Please annotate anywhere you think there might be accessibility issues and how you might get around them.
+ If you're using SASS/SCSS/LESS, please include your construction files as well as the output HTML.
Comment frequently to talk us through what you’ve done – just like you’d normally do when writing code.
